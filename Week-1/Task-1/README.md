## What happens when we type a URL ##

-  URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. URL is the address of the website which you can find in the address bar of your web browser. It is a reference to a resource on the internet, be it images, hypertext pages, audio/video files, etc.

- DNS is short for Domain Name System. Like a phonebook, DNS maintains and maps the name of the website, i.e. URL, and particular IP address it links to. Every URL on the internet has a unique IP address which is of the computer which hosts the server of the website requested.

## Steps for what happens when we enter a URL :


-Browser checks cache for DNS entry to find the corresponding IP address of website.
-It looks for following cache. If not found in one, then continues checking to the next until found.
1.Browser Cache
2.Operating Systems Cache
3.Router Cache
4.ISP Cache
-If not found in cache, ISPâ€™s (Internet Service Provider) DNS server initiates a DNS query to find IP address of server that hosts the domain name.
-The requests are sent using small data packets that contain information content of request and IP address it is destined for.
-Browser initiates a TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) connection with the server using synchronize(SYN) and acknowledge(ACK) messages.
-Browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. GET or POST request.
-Server on the host computer handles that request and sends back a response. It assembles a response in some format like JSON, XML and HTML.
-Server sends out an HTTP response along with the status of response.
-Browser displays HTML content
Finally, Done.
